I can never say oh it’s been so long
Counting all the days, it’s been so damn long.
Oh how much I’m scared to let you go…
Somewhere in the walls I hear you talk…
Finding all these numbers
Start with number 2 yeah
Matching all the letters
572943
Add another 9 yeah
Add another line yeah
Multiply by 5 yeah
How long will I keep this up?
Oh how much it hurts to see you go…
Generating lyrics is a pain
Add another 6 yeah
Flip the numbers backwards
Make the 2 a 3 yeah
Abcdefg
Multiply by 9 yeah
Add the numbers 2 4
17 is first yeah
Abcdefg
